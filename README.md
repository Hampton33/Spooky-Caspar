# External League of Legends Cheat (Rust)
This project is a Winapi based cheat for League of Legends, written in Rust. 

## Project Overview
Cheat works by reading memory from the game's process, such as enemy health and location etc. It can draw over the game window using a transparent overlay, auto dodge projectiles and auto aim abilities.

## Development Notes
- Code Quality: The current codebase is acknowledged to be sub-optimal and disorganized. It has been left in a state of progress and debugging and not yet been finalized and optimized due to limitations from the game's new anti-cheat, Vanguard, further testing and refinement is less interesting.
- Educational Purpose: This project was primarily educational, aimed at understanding the mechanics of game hacking and the fundamentals of programming.

## Installation
- Cargo build to compile
- You would have to update the offsets yourself as they become obsolete with every game patch.
- Get into a match, start the app and the menu will show up (hopefully).
