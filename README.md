# External League of Legends Cheat (Rust)
This project is a Winapi based cheat for League of Legends, written in Rust. 

## Project Overview
This cheat was developed as a personal challenge to learn the basics of reverse engineering, programming, and mathematics, starting from scratch. It includes several features, such as a projectile predictor, a cool circular gui, and an evade projectiles implementation utilizing an external is_point_in_wall function, which is relatively rare in external cheats due to its complexity.

## Development Notes
The development of this cheat has been a productive and enjoyable experience, serving as an excellent introduction to several fundamental concepts in programming and game development. However, there are some important considerations:
- Code Quality: The current codebase is acknowledged to be sub-optimal and disorganized. Due to limitations with the game's new anti-cheat, Vanguard, further testing and refinement are not feasible as of right now.
- Educational Purpose: This project was primarily educational, aimed at understanding the mechanics of game hacking and the fundamentals of programming.

## Installation
- Cargo build to compile
- You would have to update the offsets yourself as they become obsolete with every game patch.
- As of before the games new anticheat (vanguard) this remains undetected, but when vanguard is out you will have to find a bypass.
